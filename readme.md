Observation Sensitive MCTS for Elevator Transportation
======================================================

In this project, we try to adapt the AlphaZero algorithm to problems with continuous
rewards. We chose the problem of elevator transportation to apply our version of the
algorithm.

- More information about the Problem can be found in the [Final Report](https://github.com/MaxRieger96/tum-adlr-ss20-05/blob/master/Final_Report.pdf)
- A detailed description of the environment we used can be found in the [Documentation](https://github.com/MaxRieger96/tum-adlr-ss20-05/blob/master/doc/environment.md)
- The main training procedure can be found in [train.py](./src/elevator_rl/train.py)
